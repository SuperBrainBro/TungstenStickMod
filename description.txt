Can you beat Terraria with double your health, but half of your damage?

A small mod - Tungsten Stick - rewards players who play badly while also providing safety. Summary: -Damage +HP

Settings in config can tweak 'just' exactly how you want the difficulty to be affected.
Stat Impact 1: -20% damage, +25% health. Stat Impact level 3 (Default): -50% damage, +200% health. Stat Impact level 5: -90% damage, +300% health.

Can you beat the Terraria Tungsten Stick Challenge?
Or if its too easy, attempt the Glass Cannon Challenge!
